To reproduce the runs and the plots from Blecic et al. 2021 paper: 
AN OPEN-SOURCE BAYESIAN ATMOSPHERIC RADIATIVE TRANSFER (BART) CODE:
III. INITIALIZATION, ATMOSPHERIC PROFILE GENERATOR, POST-PROCESSING ROUTINES
AND APPLICATION TO EXOPLANET WASP-43B
open compendium.sh and execute the commands as listed.

This will generate all neccesery outputs and files to reproduce the paper plots.

In this repository, we provide all the outputs, obeying the github size limit.
Some intermediary files could not be included as they exceed the size limit. 

On zenodo, https://zenodo.org/deposit/xxxxx, we provide these big intermediate 
files together with all other inputs and outputs, neccessery to reproduce all 
the paper figures.
